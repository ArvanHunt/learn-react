    <h1>Hello World  | Arvan kumar</h1>
    <p>I’m thrilled to dive deeper into React and explore its amazing DOM manipulation capabilities. Today, I started learning how React DOM bridges the gap between React components and the browser.</p>
    <h4>Here’s what I learned so far:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The role of ReactDOM.render() in rendering components.</li>
      <li>How React efficiently updates the DOM with its virtual DOM mechanism.</li>
      <li>Setting up a basic React application with React DOM</li>
      <p>It’s exciting to see how powerful and seamless the process is. Looking forward to building interactive web applications and sharing my progress along the way!</p>

<h3>If you have any tips for a beginner in React DOM, I’d love to hear them!</h3>
